Dear Kishan Sir,

I wanted to express my sincerest gratitude for your guidance and teaching during the front-end development course. 
Your expertise and passion for the subject made the learning experience truly enjoyable and insightful. 
Your patience in explaining complex concepts and your willingness to help us understand every detail did not go unnoticed.

Thanks to your teachings, I now feel confident in my front-end development skills and am eager to apply them in real-world projects. 
Your dedication to your students' success is truly admirable, and I feel fortunate to have had you as my teacher.

Once again, thank you for everything, Kishan Sir. I look forward to continuing my learning journey under your mentorship.

Warm regards,

[Team DYPCMR]
